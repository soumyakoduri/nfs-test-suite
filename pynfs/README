This tree includes support for both 4.0 and 4.1 pynfs testing.  It is
the merge of what were originally two independent projects--initially
the 4.0 pynfs code was all moved into the nfs4.0 directory, but as time
passes we expect to merge the two code bases.

You can prepare both for use with
	./setup.py build
which will create auto-generated files and compile any shared libraries
in place.

For more details about 4.0 and 4.1 testing, see nfs4.0/README and
nfs4.1/README, respectively.  For information about automatic code
generation from an XDR file, see xdr/README.

Note that test results should *not* be considered authoritative
statements about the protocol--if you find that a server fails a test,
you should consult the rfc's and think carefully before assuming that
the server is at fault.  (However, we do appreciate patches if you find
a test that requires incorrect behavior.)
