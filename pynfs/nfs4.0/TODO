High Priority
=============
Add description of each test, and make it accessable w/o looking through source
Causing timeout on rename in python server with (bad) doubled calls causes
  xid on server to get stuck.  Why?
Add more delegations tests.
	Make test fail if give conflicting open w/o waiting.
	get write deleg, then have local disk access
	_EXPIRED after delegation revoked
	RENEW tests with path down
	Make sure get back proper id
	warn if responding on first open
	setclientid test changing callack info after delegation granted
Add more reboot tests.
   ask for delegation on recall, both actual and fake
fix poll/select hack in rpc.py
Recover gracefully if dispatcher dies.
CID5 run against foreign server can cause pynfs to crash by running out of
	file descriptors
Make sure owner names are unique for each test...ie don't use 'owner1' for
	several tests, instead use something like "%s_own1" % t.code
When cleanup fails, give name of file it fails on.
On cleanup, deal with remove unclosed files.

Medium Priority
===============
Allow client to bind to restricted ports.
Make sure change of default dircount from 0 to 4096 in do_readdir did 
	not affect any tests.
Deal with spurious exceptions in printout better.
Many tests rely on c1 and c2 being different, which may not be true using
	kerberos.  Check for this in dependency.
c2 is always auth_sys, use given sec
Add acl tests.
Add permissions tests.
Run tests in order given.
lock test combined w/ special stateid
setclientid tests using weird/wrong callback data
replay of seqid op with slight change to args

Low Priority
============
Why can't we do lookup using krb5p?
Add timing info to tests.
Startup time is slow while building flag database from disk.
Use python's stringprep facilities for stringprep testing.
Versioning info for showresults
Dependency functions should have possibility of being non-optional (ie --force)
  Note for example this is important with the gss tests.

Test Stuff
==========

lock tests using bad lock type INVAL vs XDR
open-write-close-remove-putfh gives OK, should be STALE
