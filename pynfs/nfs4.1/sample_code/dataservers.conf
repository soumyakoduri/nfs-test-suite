# This is the file I use while testing.  Change the IP addresses as needed.
# Any number of DS can be listed, files will stripe across them in the
# order listed.

# Each line should be of the form server[:[port][/path]]

#	server1[:[port1]],server2[:[port2]],...[/path]
# port defaults to 2049, path defaults to /
