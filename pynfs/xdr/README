Python XDR parser and code generator.  Features hooks for dealing with
opaques and flags to turn on/off checking of array lengths and enum values.

This is mature for my purposes.  Others have requested, and I may get 
around to someday:
       better error checking
       auto generation of server/client stubs
       use more of C's rpcgen syntax

Run with "./xdrgen.py BASE.x".  This will generate three files:
    BASE_const.py, BASE_type.py, and BASE_pack.py

const and enums are place in BASE_const.py.  enums will also generate
a dictionary with integers as keys and the identifier strings as values.

structs and unions are turned into classes, which are defined in BASE_type.py

Finally, the most important classes are BASEPacker and BASEUnpacker
defined in BASE_pack.py. These allow translation from XDR strings to
python classes and back.  These basically inherit from xdrlib, so see
the Python documentation on xdrlib for usage.
